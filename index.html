  <h1>History</h1>
  
  <p>In the 1870s, the telegraphic specialist, <strong>Elisha Gray</strong>, conducted research to transmit simultaneously several messages on the same line of the telegraph (invented in 1837), using alternating and non-continuous current, research that would lead to the invention the phone. At the same time, American-born speech-language pathologist <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell" target = "_blank">Graham Bell</a> did almost identical work and was the first to patent the invention of the voice transmission system. 
Thus, on March 10, 1876, Graham Bell succeeded in the first transmission on electric wires of a voice message, to a room on another floor, where his assistant <strong>Thomas Watson</strong> was standing, a phrase still famous: "Mr. Watson, come here, I need you! "

  <h1>Technology</h1>
  <p>The traditional wired telephony uses several techniques, the first is the modulation at low frequencies (vocal frequencies) of a carrier current on a two-wire line. The second, the power supply by a central battery and the third is that of the switched lines.

  <h1>Evolution</h1>
  <p>The operating principle of the phone:
A metal plate attached to a membrane is activated by the voice and vibrates in front of an electromagnet. These vibrations make it possible to produce a variable electric current. Thanks to an electric cable, the electric current can be transported and the speech becomes transmissible.
At the other end of the cable, at the receiver, a device identical to the first can reproduce the voice.
